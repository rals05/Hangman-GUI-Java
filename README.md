Project Title:
Hangman-GUI-Java

Description:
A Marvel-themed Hangman game built in Java using JavaFX for the GUI. Players try to guess the letters of Marvel character names. Each incorrect guess adds a body part to the hangman drawing.

Features:
1- Fully interactive GUI with clickable alphabet buttons
2- Dynamic hangman drawing with six body parts
3- Displays correctly guessed letters in real time 
4- “Play Again” button to restart the game
5- Variety of Marvel character names
6- First-time JavaFX project showcasing GUI development skills

Why I made this:
I created this project to practice Java, JavaFX, and basic game logic while building a fun, thematic game. This is my first time using JavaFX, so it was a great opportunity to learn GUI development and create an engaging, interactive game. It also allowed me to experiment with game design and user experience for the first time.
